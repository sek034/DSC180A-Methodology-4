**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic was how different technologies and software, such as React, Supabase, DigitalOcean, and n8n, can be integrated into a single scalable AI-powered educational system. I was able to understand the significance of full-stack collaboration in developing effective AI teaching tools after learning about the interactions between frontend, backend, and workflow automation.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Next quarter, I’d like to explore how gamified elements like XP, awards, and streaks affect student motivation and learning results. To gauge participation before and after incorporating these gamified components, we could carry out a brief usability study with students from UCSD or nearby high schools. I believe these results could guide how we refine the reward system in our AI learning app.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would add a structured evaluation process earlier in the development timeline. So far, we have mostly focused on technical setup and have not gathered user feedback yet. Next time, I’d like to involve potential users like UCSD students (freshmen) or high schoolers earlier to test prototypes and give feedback on usability.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I’m interested in implementing data analytics dashboards using tools like Supabase SQL views or Plotly to monitor student progress, question difficulty patterns, and engagement metrics. This would not only help us evaluate our app’s performance but also allow instructors to see classwide insights.
